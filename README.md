# Caffeinated HTML ☕

**I made this repo to test methods for writing webpages in CoffeeScript (using as much coffee as I can).**

**My end [goal](https://github.com/Sh-ui/caffeinated-html/blob/fix-reference/README.md#goals--documentation) / intention with this project is to develop sites as such:**
  - Write the main core of the page in coffeescript (integrating HTML, JS, and CSS whenever possible).
  - Potentially integrate less, md, litcoffee, and other web-convertible langs
  - Modularize page components to be used and edited quickly and easily (header, footer, etc.)
  - Process all code across many components &/or languages to a single HTML file that is compiled and minified &/or compressed
    to be used efficiently and in a browser or app.
  - Images and other assets will likely be outsourced, but with code that is unique to **your page** united

</br>

Ultimately this system strives to break up development into concise chunks of code and content that are easy to understand and edit, allowing developers to: get more done faster, find errors quickly, improve sustainability, etc.
