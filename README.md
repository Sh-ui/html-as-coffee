# html-as-coffee

**I made this repo to test methods for writing wepages in CoffeeScript (using as much coffee as I can).**

**My end goal / intention with this project is to write weppages as such:**
  - Write the main core of the page in coffeescript (integrating HTML, JS, and possibly CSS into one document).
  - Integrate less, css and other external components through git.
  - Execute all code to a single HTML file that compiles and minifies all base code 
    to be used quickly and automatically in the browser.
